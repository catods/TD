Objectvive:
This project consist of the cleaning and tidying the data from Human Activity 
Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set machine learning experiment as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject.

The project include the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the data sources and data transformation during the tidying.

- 'TidyngData.R': R script for tidying the data.

Note: The resulting data set are not printed, nor exported to a file.
